# Infrared-Transceiver-with-LinkIt-7687-HDK---Part-1

This tutorial is the first in the sequence of tutorials based on the features of the <a href="http://labs.mediatek.com/site/global/developer_tools/mediatek_linkit_rtos/what_is_linkit_rtos/index.gsp">LinkIt 7687 HDK</a> to create an infrared radiation (IR) transciever. The board receives IR data through an IR receiver, sends IR data based on the commands in the MediaTek Cloud Services (MCS). Part 1 of the tutorial covers details on capturing IR signals emitted from any remote controller including home appliances such TV, air conditioner unit and more.  Part 2 of the tutorial describes connectivity with MCS, sending commands and emitting IR signals based on the commands received. 

If you haven’t built a LinkIt 7687 project before, you need to download and install the LinkIt SDK v3, then configure your development environment. Full details of how to do this are provided in the <a href="http://labs.mediatek.com/site/global/developer_tools/mediatek_linkit_rtos/get_started/index.gsp">Get Started with the MediaTek LinkIt™ Development Platform for RTOS</a>. Once you’ve completed this setup you’ll be ready to continue with this tutorial. 

The attached file contains GCC, inc, src folders, including the source and header files of the project.
